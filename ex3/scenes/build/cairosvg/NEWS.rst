Version 0.2, released on 2012-01-04
===================================

* **Change the Python API again** to be compatible with 0.1.1 and before:
  ``svg2pdf(source_as_bytes) -> bytes`` but still support filenames or
  file objects with keyword-only parameters. See the docstrings.

Version 0.1.2, released on 2011-12-14

**Backward incompatible change** in the Python API: previously the input

interpreted as a filename, but file-like objects are also accepted.
Use a StringIO object if you have SVG content in a string.
